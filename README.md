# SQLite sakila database

Sakila SQLite database script plugin for Magic that installs the Sakila database into
your _"/etc/sqlite/templates/"_ folder for you, for then to execute the SQL script, creating
the Sakila database for you, allowing you to play around with the CRUD generator with a
real database. This database is a port of the [Sakila sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/)
provided by MySql for testing its functions and features. It represents an online DVD store.
The history of the database can be found in the above link.
